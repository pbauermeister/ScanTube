# TODO

## Easy
- Full-screen app
- Camera preview in a square view
- Button on the side
- When photo is taken, display it instead of camera preview; reactivate camera preview when detection process is finished
- If playlist not found, try just video
- Draggable floating control on top of all apps, to return to ScanTube

## Less easy
- Auto-shoot: with image recognition, detect when square object is here and taking enough space

## Advanced
- Possibility to target your own collection of songs, instead of YouTube
- Possibility to train image detection from own CD covers or images
