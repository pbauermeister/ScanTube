# PRIVACY POLICY FOR MOBILE APPLICATION "SCANTUBE"

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application ScanTube (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Pascal Bauermeister. The Application lets user (1) take a photo of a CD cover, (2) passes the photo to the Google Cloud Vision service for recognition to obtain keywords, (3) searches for a corresponding playlist on YouTube, and (4) launches YouTube on found playlist. The steps 2 and 3 are what we call a "CD search".
