# ScanTube

## What is ScanTube?

ScanTube is an Android App, written in Kotlin (*).

This poject has the following features:
- Scanning a CD cover,
- searching (via Google Image) for the title as text,
- searching (via YouTube) for a matching playlist,
- then launching YouTube on the found playlist.

The objective is to embed a smartphone into a vintage boombox, to
retrofit it as a YouTube player.

## Motivation

This way, "virtual CDs" (YouTube playlists) are played by showing the
boombox a CD case you own, or photo. This makes a combination of the
old ages in which you had to own your music, and the new all-digital
age.

## Status

Very basic working proof of concept.

1. Build the app (to add your app keys, see README_KEY.md [README_KEY.md](README_KEY.md))
2. Run the app. The camera starts.
3. Show a CD coverto the camera, avoid reflexions, and press the button
4. Wait for recognition. If it works, YouTube gets called on the found playlist
